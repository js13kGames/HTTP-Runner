# HTTP Runner
My entry for the JS13K 2020 Game Jam. This year's theme was **404**.

## How to play

You play as an HTTP request and you must find all the 5 files in each stage to
progress. However, you must not get caught by the firewall agent, which has
gone haywire and is targetting innocent requests such as yourself. Use the
WASD keys or arrow keys to move. Get all the files and get to the exit to go to
the next stage. Clear all 5 stages to win.

## Building and running

Before running this project for the first time you must install the required
dependencies
```
npm install
```

To run the project just run
```

```

To bundle eveything into a single HTML file and compress it, run
```
npm run build
```
